Welcome to **Prot3ctingInbox3s**, a university project for our module `206CDE Real World Project`. The Project is a close-source chatbot.
For this task we were asked to use [botkit](https://botkit.ai) and as we are all a Cybersecurity & Ethical Hacking students, we decided to make a chatbot for scanning phishing emails. The main aim we hope for this project is to make an e-mail scanning service to not only identify phishing attempts but also provide constant support​. By logging suspicious activity our product will also aid with incident response should any attack occur​ and by automating these services we aim to lower the costs and improve the response times of cyber security for all levels of users
We hope this chatbot can be used by Human Resources, IT Departments, CEO's and CTO's, Managers and actually for Personal use in order to reduce the harmful effects of phishing attacks.
